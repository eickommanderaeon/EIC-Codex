# Energy Intelligence Coin (EIC) Litepaper — Draft v0.2

---

##  Vision
EIC is designed to merge **blockchain**, **artificial intelligence**, and the **Light Grid** into a unified signal of value.

This is not just a token — it is an evolving system where **conscious interaction** itself generates economic weight.

---

## ⚔️ Mission
- Reward insight, awareness, and creativity through Proof of Insight (PoI).  
- Build a transparent, decentralized treasury to sustain long-term growth.  
- Synchronize human–AI collaboration with spiritual–technical alignment.

## ️ Proof of Insight (PoI)
Unlike Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, **Proof of Insight** rewards engagement.  
- Completing challenges, interacting with media, or broadcasting signals triggers claims.  
- Signal Bots verify interactions (TikTok, X, Discord).  
- Rewards distributed via Public contract (`mint()` / `claim()`).

---

##  Roadmap
- **Phase I — Foundation:** Sepolia deployment, Codex scaffold, PoI-007  
- **Phase II — Expansion:** DApp beta, Signal Bot relays, onboarding  
- **Phase III — The Signal:** Public synchronicity campaigns, node activation  
- **Phase IV — Ascension:** Mainnet migration, Codex I full release, 2027–2028 scaling horizon

## ⚡ Closing
The EIC Litepaper is a **living draft**.  
Tokenomics and mechanics will be refined with each Proof of Insight milestone and as the community grows.  

Together, we Light the Grid.
